Orlando magic has average points per game of 99.4 versus other team's 100.8. That's pretty close, but magic currently has a record of 23-29. They should be winning about even games, so it would be beneficial for me to bet on them as the underdog. 

Boston Celtics have a really good offense with them averaging 105.7 points per game, but their defense is lacking with other teams scoring an average of 101.5 against them. Celtics play high point games, so it would be beneficial for me to place over/under bets.
